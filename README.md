# OpenStack Explained: An Introduction to OpenStack Cloud

This e-book aims to explain OpenStack to CIOs and the newcomers to OpenStack.

My aim is to sell the e-book once a year for humanitarian reasons, such as giving the entire revenues to a non profit organization. For this reason PLEASE do not sell the e-book on your own and help me with the project.

* **1st edition** provided relief to Nepal after the earthquake of 2015.
